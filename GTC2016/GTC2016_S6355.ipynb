    "[PetIBM](https://github.com/barbagroup/PetIBM) is a parallel code to study flow around immersed bodies, solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a Cartesian mesh. The body can be embedded in the fluid mesh via the so-called _immersed boundary method_ (IBM), which brings many advantages in regards to mesh generation. The equations are discretized with a finite-difference scheme, via a pressure-projection method, resulting in a Poisson-like linear system. PetIBM uses the [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) library to solve the linear system of equations in parallel on CPU hardware, and now we want to accelerate it with the help of GPU computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our group previously developed another code, [cuIBM](https://github.com/barbagroup/cuIBM), which implements the same methods as PetIBM, except that it runs on a sigle CPU and a single GPU, using the [CUSP](http://cusplibrary.github.io) library to solve the linear system. The limited memory on a single GPU restricts the size of CFD problems that we can solve using cuIBM to about 4 million mesh points. In three dimensions, we often need to solve larger problems, which led us to develop PetIBM. Our next step was to add the capability of exploiting multi-GPU systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we set out to accelerate PetIBM using the NVIDIA [AmgX](https://developer.nvidia.com/amgx) library on multi-GPUs. We wrote a wrapper code to couple AmgX and PETSc, so that we require few modifications in PetIBM. Our [AmgX wrapper](https://github.com/barbagroup/AmgXWrapper) is able to handle the situation where the PETSc-based code launches more MPI processes than the number of GPUs available, achieving heterogeneous speed-up. It is open source and we hope others may find it useful to accelerate their PETSc-based parallel programs with multiple GPUs."

In unsteady CFD applications, with time-marching iterations, users would simply call `solve` repeatedly.  But there should be no need to be concerned about data conversion: `A`, `x`, and `rhs` are all PETSc data structures, and remain so, on the application side. We also would like configuration to be done simply through an input script during runtime.\n",

    "The wrapper code equips the PETSc application software with access to AmgX, without the burden of unpacking data structures from one into the other. Without it, to use AmgX from PETSc one would have to access the raw data from the sparse matrix in PETSc, then redistribute as needed across MPI processes to consolidate the data in a way that can be sent to the GPU device. Next, the application would need to initialize AmgX and allocate memory on the GPU—using the  API only, users would need about 10 different AmgX functions for just this part. Users would need more code to set up the matrix and vectors and send from host to device, then set up the solver, solve and finalize.  With our wrapper, users only need to declare an instance of the solver with `AmgXWrapper solver` and then call `solver.initialize(...)`.

    "We found it necessary to write a wrapper to couple AmgX and PETSc, which we release openly in case others find it useful.\n",
    "Our wrapper efficiently manages the situation when we want to launch the PETSc-based program with more MPI processes than the number of available GPUs.\n",
    "We can thus utilize as many CPU cores as available to run the parts that still remain on the CPU-side of the application code, and use as many GPUs as available to accelerate the linear solvers on AmgX.\n",
    "\n",
    "On our benchmarks solving standard Poisson problems with 25M unknowns, we obtained a **5x** speed-up on four K20s, compared to one 16-core CPU node, in the 2D case.\n",
    "In the 3D case, we obtained a **13.2x** speedup with eight K20s using AmgX, compared to one 16-core CPU node.\n",
    "The minimum number of GPUs, in this case, is dictated by our memory needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On larger Poisson benchmarks, with 100M unknowns in 2D and 50M unknowns in 3D, we prefer to look at the equivalent size of a CPU cluster that would give the same speedup as a GPU cluster. We get that about 400 CPU cores would be needed to give similar speed-ups to a 32-GPU cluster (with speedups of 17.6x and 20.8x, respectively).\n",
    "On a real application (flying snake simulations), with almost 3M mesh points, we obtained a **21x** speedup on one K20 GPU, compared to one 12-core CPU node.\n",
