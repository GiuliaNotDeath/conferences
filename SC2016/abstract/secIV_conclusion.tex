With our wrapper, which bridges PETSc and AmgX, existing PETSc-based CFD codes 
can now exploit all CPU and GPU resources with affordable coding effort
by simplily replacing PETSc's
\lstinline[language=C++, basicstyle=\ttfamily]|KSPSetOperators| and 
\lstinline[language=C++, basicstyle=\ttfamily]|KSPSolve| 
with our wrapper's
\lstinline[language=C++, basicstyle=\ttfamily]|setA| and
\lstinline[language=C++, basicstyle=\ttfamily]|solve|. 
We believe the wrapper can help those who want migrate their existing CFD codes 
to modern heterogeneous platforms but try to avoid significant modifications 
in the codes.

In additions, the benchmarks suggest that multi-GPU computing can size down the 
cluster systems required and money cost for scientific simulations.
These benefits are attractive to researchers who have limited hardware resources
for their scientific simulations.
