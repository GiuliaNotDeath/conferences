The starting point of this work is a desire to accelerate existing 
PETSc\cite{petsc-web-page}-based CFD codes with multi-GPU computing.
For researchers who focus on applications of CFD instead of software development,
rewriting their whole code with CUDA/OpenCL may be too onerous.
The most expensive part in CFD codes is typically solving Poisson-like systems,
for which NVIDIA's AmgX\cite{amgx-web-page} library provides multi-GPU solvers.
We present a wrapper code to bridge AmgX and PETSc so that users can 
run their existing PETSc-based CFD codes on modern heterogeneous platforms, 
with minimal code changes.

We assessed the overall benefits of using multi-GPU systems in CFD applications
when replacing PETSc linear solvers by AmgX.
While application speed-up\footnotemark was our top concern, we also studied 
other possible benefits, such as savings in terms of hardware and cost.
We used Poisson systems in 2D and 3D as benchmarks to determine such benefits

\footnotetext{
    Speed-ups in our works refer to {\it application speed-ups}: 
    directly replace PETSc linear solvers with AmgX solvers in an application
    and see what acceleration the application can have. 
    In other words, 
    these application speed-ups represent the overall reductions of run times 
    that users of the applications can experience.
