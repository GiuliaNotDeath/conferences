The starting point of this work is a desire to accelerate existing 
PETSc\cite{petsc-web-page}-based CFD codes with multi-GPU computing.
For researchers who focus on applications of CFD instead of software development,
rewriting whole code with CUDA/OpenCL may be the least thing they want.
As the most expensive part in CFD codes is typically solving Poisson-like systems,
tackling only this part with libraries providing multi-GPU linear solvers, 
such as NVIDIA's AmgX\cite{amgx-web-page}, is more acceptable.
The goal here is to write a wrapper to bridge AmgX and PETSc so that users can 
make their existing PETSc-based CFD codes running on modern heterogeneous platforms
and, at the mean time, with only simple modifications in their code.

In additions, we wondered the overall benefits the multi-GPU computing can give us.
While speed-up\footnotemark is always our top concern, we were also curious 
about other possible benefits, such as cost savings or hardware savings.
Therefore, we performed a series of benchmarks beside the coding task of the 
wrapper for this purpose.

\footnotetext{
    Speed-ups in our works refer to {\it application speed-ups}: 
    directly replace PETSc linear solvers with AmgX solvers in an application
    and see what acceleration the application can have. 
    In other words, 
    these application speed-ups represent the overall reductions of run times 
    that users of the applications can experience.
