\begin{abstract}
    We wrote a wrapper code to couple PETSc and AmgX libraries in order to utilize AmgX's multi-GPU linear solvers in arbitrary PETSc-based applications.
    The wrapper features a simple usage (with normally only two function calls) and capability to exploit all available CPU and GPU resources,
    which is accomplished through converting data structures implicitly between the two libraries,
    hiding MPI communications,
    and merging sub-systems without users' knowing.
    We performed benchmarks to understand application speed-ups after incorporating multi-GPU capability in PETSc applications. 
    Results of benchmarks suggest that, with multi-GPU computing, we can save 
    1) run times and hardware cost (e.g.\ a 6-CPU-core workstation with 1 NVIDIA K40c can compete with a 16-node CPU cluster); and
    2) cloud HPC cost (e.g.\ a benchmark on Amazon EC2 shows a 16x cost saving between CPU and GPU clusters)
    of scientific simulations.

\section{Introduction}

Researchers have been developing and running 
PETSc\cite{petsc-web-page, petsc-user-ref, petsc-efficient} 
applications for scientific simulations on CPU clusters for over 20 years.
As GPU computing becomes popular nowadays, 
running scientific simulations on heterogeneous platforms and exploit all CPU and GPU resources may be desired.
PETSc, however, still doesn't have satisfying support of multi-GPU computing,
so moving those mature PETSc applications from CPU platforms to heterogeneous platforms may be tricky.
